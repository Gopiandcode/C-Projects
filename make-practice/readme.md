# A collection of my experiments in make
## The gnu make utility.

As a keen C programmer, a common filetype that I find in Opensource projects is the makefile. While the semantics of the make file aren't too hard to decipher in most cases, I've been reluctant to "make" (lol) my own due to a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the syntax.

As make is an integral part of modern c programming, I've resolved to spend some time to decipher the underlying mechanics of make.

As with all my projects, I've listed my findings here...
