# A Section Depicting my brief excursion into FFT
One day I wanted to try looking into FFT - it's mentioned a lot, and it's the kind of thing
that sounds cool. And if you know me, you know I'm all about racking up that sweet street cred.

So, after a detour to Coremans, I looked up the theory, and implemented the basic recursive fft.
It's simple, but I can see how the algorithm works now.

A while back, I read up on some Fourier transforms to impress some Maths friends of mine,
so I have a basic understanding of why a fourier transform is useful, but I can't fully comprehend,
at the moment, how this algorithm helps.
